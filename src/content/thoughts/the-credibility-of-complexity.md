Complexity intensifies as internet development evolves. Remember the early days? A simple website with basic HTML and a few images was enough. But, new tech and higher standards have made it hard to make tools for users.

Government agencies often think that complex solutions are better. This belief is most visible during the procurement process. It's perceived that complex systems with the latest technology are more reliable. These systems can handle the needs of public services. This belief leads agencies to invest in complex applications. They assume that more features and advanced capabilities mean better performance and security. The result leads to increased support costs and platform lock-in in the future.

> Keep it simple

Yet, there's a strong case for simpler approaches, especially for government agencies. Complex applications might seem more credible, yet simpler solutions offer key benefits. These benefits are often overlooked due to a bias towards complexity.

First, simpler applications are much cheaper to develop. They need fewer resources. This includes time and money. This makes them great for tight government budgets. This cost-effectiveness continues with maintenance. Simpler systems are easier to update and fix, reducing long-term costs.

## Developer experience is important

When it comes to development resources, simpler architectures are a big win. They need fewer specialized skills. They also need less training to build and maintain. This means smaller teams can do development and upkeep. It reduces the need to hire large, highly specialized staff or consultants. Small teams can work well together. They can quickly adapt to changes or fix issues. This leads to faster turnarounds and better use of resources.

## Maintenance and security

Maintenance is another big plus. Simpler applications have fewer parts and dependencies. Smaller teams can manage them with fewer errors. This ensures smoother operation and quicker changes and improvements. In government, systems need to be reliable and always working. So, a simple architecture is a big advantage. Fewer moving parts mean fewer things can go wrong. This leads to higher stability, reliability, and ease of use.

Security is also a major factor. Complexity creates more points of weakness. It makes systems harder to secure. Simplicity helps agencies. It lets them make strong security. This cuts the risk of breaches and data loss. Simpler architectures are easier to check and monitor. They ensure that security protocols are always followed.

Also, simpler apps can still meet government needs. Simpler solutions can have reliable, efficient, and user-friendly interfaces. They strive to provide public services efficiently.

At Rudder, we thrive on working with our partners to develop elegant solutions. We believe that solutions should provide a great experience for constituents and stakeholders. We work with our partners to design systems that can last well into the future and don't require massive contracts to keep running.
